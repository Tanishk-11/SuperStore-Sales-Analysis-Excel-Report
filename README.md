### üöÄ Key Features & Analysis

* **Interactive Controls:** The dashboard is equipped with a **Region Slicer**, allowing users to filter the entire report and analyze the performance of a specific region (Central, East, South, West) with a single click.

* **Year-over-Year Trend Analysis:** A line chart visualizes key metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity) over a four-year period (2014-2017), clearly showing strong business growth, particularly after 2015.

* **Product Category & Profitability Breakdown:** A sorted bar chart provides a clear comparison of product sub-categories, highlighting:
    * **Top Performers:** "Copiers" and "Phones" are identified as major drivers of both sales and profit.
    * **Problem Areas:** "Tables" and "Bookcases" are revealed to be unprofitable, generating significant losses for the company despite their sales volume.
